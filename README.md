Easy to use functions to do Bayesian Statistics on a data with predefined priors and likelihoods that I used over and over while doing analysis.
Especially useful for estimating revenue in a two way proces:
1. Estimate Conversion Rate - using beta-bernoulli model
2. Estimate Revenue per Payer - using gamma-exponential model
3. Estimate Revenue Per User - by combining results from 1. and 2.
